<h2>MAMMY TITTLEBACK<br />

AND HER FAMILY.<br />

I.</h2>


<p>Mammy Tittleback is a splendid
great tortoise-shell cat,&mdash;yellow
and black and white; nearly equal
parts of each color, except on
her tail and her face. Her tail is
all black; and her face is white,
with only a little black and yellow
about the ears and eyes. Her
face is a very kind-looking face, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
her tail is a fierce one; and when she
is angry, she can swell it up in a minute,
till it looks almost as big as her
body.</p>

<p>Nobody knows where Mammy
Tittleback was born, or where she
came from. She appeared one morning
at Mr. Frank Wellington's, in the
town of Mendon in Pennsylvania.
Phil and Fred Wellington, Mr.
Frank Wellington's boys, liked her
looks, and invited her to stay; that
is, they gave her all the milk she
wanted to drink, and that is the best
way to make a cat understand that
you want her to live with you. So
she stayed, and Phil and Fred named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
her Mammy Tittleback after a cat
they had read about in the "New
York Tribune."</p>

<p>Phil and Fred have two cousins
who often go to visit them. Their
names are Johnny and Rosy Chapman;
and if it had not been for
Johnny and Rosy Chapman, there
would never have been this nice story
to tell about Mammy Tittleback: for
Phil and Fred are big boys, and do
not care very much about cats; they
like to see them around, and to make
them comfortable; but Johnny and
Rosy are quite different. Johnny is
only eight and Rosy six, and they
love cats and kittens better than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>thing
else in the world; and when
they went to spend this last summer
at their Uncle Frank Wellington's,
and found Mammy Tittleback with
six little kittens, just born, they
thought such a piece of luck never
had happened before to two children.</p>

<p>Juniper and Mousiewary had been
born the year before. Phil named
these. Juniper was a splendid great
fellow, nearly all white. At first he
was called "Junior," but they changed
it afterward to "Juniper," because, as
Phil said, they didn't know what his
father's name was, and there wasn't
any sense in calling him "Junior,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and, besides, "Juniper" sounded
better.</p>

<p>Mousiewary was white, with a black
and yellow head. Phil called her
"Mousiewary" because she would lie
still so long watching for a mouse.
She was a year and a half old when
Johnny and Rosy went to their Uncle
Frank's for this visit, and she had
two little kittens of her own that
could just run about. They were
wild little things, and very fierce, so
Phil had called them the Imps. But
Johnny and Rosy soon got them so
tame that this name did not suit them
any longer, and then they named them
over again "Beauty" and "Clover."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Mammy Tittleback's second family
of kittens were born in the barn,
on the hay. After a while she moved
them into an old wagon that was not
used. This was very clever of her,
because they could not get out of the
wagon and run away. But pretty soon
she moved them again, to a place
which the children did not approve
of at all; it was a sort of hollow in
the ground, under a great pile of fence
rails that were lying near the cowshed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 422px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;After a while she moved them into an old wagon that was not used.&quot;&mdash;</span><a href="#Page_14"><span class="caption smcap">Page</span><span class="caption">&nbsp;14.</span></a>
</div>

<p>This did not seem a nice place,
and the children could not imagine
why she moved them there. I think,
myself, she moved them to try and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>hide them away from the children.
I don't believe she thought it was
good for the kittens to be picked up
so many times a day, and handled,
and kissed, and talked to. I dare
say she thought they'd never have a
chance to grow if she couldn't hide
them away from Johnny and Rosy
for a few weeks. You see, Johnny
and Rosy never left them alone for
half a day. They were always carrying
them about. When people came
to the house to see their Aunt Mary,
the children would cry, "Don't you
want to see our six kittens? We'll
bring them in to you." Then they
would run out to the barn, take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
basket, fill it half full of hay, and
very gently lay all the kittens in it,
and Johnny would take one handle
and Rosy the other, and bring it to
the house. They always put Mammy
Tittleback in too; but before they had
carried her far, she generally jumped
out, and walked the rest of the way
by their side. She would never leave
them a minute till they had carried
the kittens safe back again to their
nest. She did not try to prevent
their taking them, for she knew that
neither Johnny nor Rosy would hurt
one of them any more than she would;
but I have no doubt in her heart she
disliked to have the kittens touched.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 372px;">

house.&quot;&mdash;Page 16." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Johnny would take one handle, and Rosy the other, and bring it to the

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>The children worried a great deal
about this last place that Mammy
Tittleback had selected for her nursery.
They thought it was damp;
and they were afraid the rails would
fall down some day and crush the
poor little kittens to death; and what
was worst of all, very often when they
went there to look at them, they could
not get any good sight of them at all,
they would be so far in among the
rails.</p>

<p>At last a bright idea struck Johnny.
He said he would build a nice house
for them.</p>

<p>"You can't," said Rosy.</p>

<p>"I can too," said Johnny. "'Twon't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
be a house such as folks live in, but
it'll do for cats."</p>

<p>"Will it be as nice as a dog's
house, Johnny?" asked Rosy.</p>

<p>"Nicer," said Johnny; "that is,
it'll be prettier. 'Twon't be so close.
Cats don't need it so close; but it'll
be prettier. It's going to have flags
on it."</p>

<p>"Flags! O Johnny!" exclaimed
Rosy. "That'll be splendid; but
we haven't got any flags."</p>

<p>"I know where I can get as many
as I want," said Johnny,&mdash;"down to
the club-room. They give flags to
boys there."</p>

<p>"What for, Johnny?" asked Rosy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, just to carry," replied Johnny
proudly. "They like to have boys
carrying their flags round."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they'll like to
have them on a cat's house?" asked
Rosy.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Johnny; and
Rosy did not know what to say.</p>

<p>Very hard Johnny worked on the
house; and it was a queer-looking
house when it was done, but it was
the only one I ever heard of that was
built on purpose for cats. It was
about eight feet square; the central
support of it was an old saw-horse
turned up endwise, with a mason's
trestle on top; the roof was made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
old rails, and had two slopes to it,
like real houses' roofs; the sides
were uneven, because on one side the
rails rested on an old pig-trough, and
on the other on a wooden trestle
which was higher than the trough.
This unevenness troubled Johnny,
but it really made the house prettier.
The space under this roof was divided
by rows of small stakes into
three compartments,&mdash;one large one
for Mammy Tittleback and her six
youngest kittens; Mousiewary and
her two kittens in another smaller
room; and the adopted kittens and
Juniper in a third. I haven't told you
yet about the adopted kittens, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
will presently. These three rooms
had each a tin pan set in the middle,
and fixed firm in its place by small
stakes driven into the ground around
it. Johnny was determined to teach
the cats to keep in their own rooms,
and that each family must eat by
itself. It wasn't so hard to bring
this about as you would have supposed,
because Johnny and Rosy
spent nearly all their time with the
cats, and every time any cat or kitten
stepped over the little wall of stakes
into the apartment of another family,
it was very gently lifted up and put
back again into its own room, and
stroked and told in gentle voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stay in your own room, kitty."</p>

<p>And at meal-times there was very
little trouble, after the first few days,
with anybody but Juniper. All the
rest learned very soon which milk-pan
belonged to them, and would run
straight to it, as soon as Johnny called
them. But Juniper was an independent
cat; and he persisted in
walking about from room to room,
pretty much as he pleased. You see
he was the only unemployed cat in
the set. Mammy Tittleback had her
hands full,&mdash;I suppose you ought to
say paws full when you are speaking
of cats,&mdash;with six kittens of her own
and two adopted ones; and Mousie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>wary
was just as busy with her two
kittens as if she had had ten; but
Juniper had nobody to look after
except himself. He was a lazy cat
too. He always used to walk slowly
to his meals. The rest would all be
running and jumping in their hurry
to get to the house when Johnny and
Rosy called them; but Juniper would
come marching along as slowly as if
he were in no sort of hurry, in fact,
as if he didn't care whether he had
anything to eat or not. But once he
got to the pan he would drink fully
his share, and more too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<h2>II.</h2>


<p>Now I must tell you about the
adopted kittens. They belonged to
a wild cat who lived in the garden.
Nobody knew anything about this
cat. She was a kind of a beggar and
thief cat, Johnny said. She wouldn't
let you take care of her, or get near
her; and the only reason she took up
her abode in the garden with her kittens
was so as to be near the milk-house,
and have a chance now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
then to steal milk out of the great kettles.
One day the children found the
poor thing dead in the chicken yard.
What killed her there was nothing to
show, but dead she was, and no mistake;
so the children carried her away
and buried her, and then went to look
for her little kittens. There were four
of them, and the poor little things were
half dead from hunger. Their mother
must have been dead some time before
the children found her. They
were too young to be fed, and the
only chance for saving their lives was
to get Mammy Tittleback to adopt
them.</p>

<p>"She's got an awful big family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
now," said Phil, "but we might try
her."</p>

<p>"She won't know but they're her
own, if we don't let them all suck at
once," said Johnny; "but it wouldn't
be fair to cheat her that way."</p>

<p>"Won't know!" said Phil. "That's
all you know about cats! She'll
know they ain't hers as quick as she
sees them."</p>

<p>It was a very droll sight to see
Mammy Tittleback when the strange
kittens were put down by her side.
She was half asleep, and some of her
own kittens had gone to sleep sucking
their dinners; but the instant these
poor famished little things were put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
down by her, two of them began to
suck as if they had never had anything
to eat before, since they were
born. Mammy Tittleback opened
her eyes, and jumped up so quick
she knocked all the kittens head
over heels into a heap. Then she
began smelling at kitten after kitten,
and licking her own as she
smelled them, till she came to the
strangers, when she growled a little,
and sniffed and sniffed; if cats could
turn up their noses, she'd have turned
up hers, but as she couldn't she only
growled and pushed them with her
paw, and looked at them, all the time
sniffing contemptuously. Johnny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and Rosy were nearly ready to
cry.</p>

<p>"Is she 'dopting 'em?" whispered
Rosy.</p>

<p>"Keep still, can't you!" said Phil;
"don't interrupt her. Let her do as
she wants to."</p>

<p>The children held their breaths
and watched. It looked very discouraging.
Mammy Tittleback walked
round and round, looking much perplexed
and not at all pleased. One
minute she would stand still and
stare at the pile of kittens, as if she
did not know what to make of it;
then she would fall to smelling and
licking her own. At last, by mistake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>perhaps, she gave a little lick to one
of the orphans.</p>

</div>

<p>"Oh, oh," screamed Johnny, "she's
going to, she's licked it;" at which
Phil gave Johnny a great shake, and
told him to be quiet or he'd spoil
everything. Presently Mammy Tittleback
lay down again and stretched
herself out, and in less than a minute
all six of her own kittens and the two
strongest of the strangers were sucking
away as hard as ever they could.</p>

<p>The children jumped for joy; but
their joy was dampened by the sight
of the other two feeble little kittens,
who lay quite still and did not try to
crowd in among the rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are they dead?" asked Rosy.</p>

<p>"No," said Johnny, picking them
up,&mdash;"no; but I guess they will die
pretty soon, they don't maow." And
he laid them down very gently close
in between Mammy Tittleback's
hind legs.</p>

<p>"Well, they might as well," remarked
Phil. "Eight kittens are
enough. Mammy Tittleback can't
bring up all the kittens in the town,
you needn't think. She's a real old
brick of a cat to take these two. I
hope the others will die anyhow."</p>

<p>"O Phil," said Rosy, "couldn't
we find some other cat to 'dopt these
two?" Rosy's tender heart ached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
as hard at the thought of these motherless
little kittens as if they had been
a motherless little boy and girl.</p>

<p>"No," said Phil, "I don't know
any other cat round here that's got
kittens."</p>

<p>"But, Phil," persisted Rosy, "isn't
there some cat that hasn't got any
kittens that would like some?"</p>

<p>Phil looked at Rosy for a minute
without speaking, then he burst out
laughing and said to Johnny, "Come
on; what's the use talking?"</p>

<p>Then Rosy looked very much hurt,
and ran into the house to ask her
Aunt Mary if she didn't know of
any cat that would adopt the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
poor little kittens that Mammy Tittleback
wouldn't take.</p>

<p>The next morning, when the children
went out to visit their cats, the
two feeble little kittens were dead, so
that put an end to all trouble on that
score, and left only thirteen cats for
the children to take care of.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how fast young
cats grow. It seemed only a few
days before all eight of these little
kittens were big enough to run around,
and a very pretty sight it was to see
them following Johnny and Rosy
wherever they went.</p>

<p>Spitfire was Johnny's favorite from
the beginning. He was a sharp, spry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
fellow, not very good-natured to anybody
but Johnny. Rosy was really
afraid of him, even while he was little;
but Johnny made him his chief
pet, and told him everything that
happened.</p>

<p>Mammy Tittleback had divided
her own colors among her kittens
very oddly. "Spitfire" was all yellow
and white; "Coaley" was black as a
coal, and that was why he was called
"Coaley." "Blacky" was black and
white; "Limbab," white with gray
spots; "Gregory Second," gray with
white spots; and "Lily" was as white
as snow, for which reason she got her
pretty name. Rosy wanted her called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
"White Lily," but the boys thought
it too long. Where there were so
many cats, they said, none of the
names ought to be more than two
syllables long, if you could help it.
"Gregory" had to be called "Gregory
Second," because there was another
Gregory already, an old cat over at
Grandma Jameson's, and it was for
him that this kitten was named; and
"Tottontail" had to be called "Tottontail,"
because he was all over gray,
with just a little bit of white at the
tip of his tail, like a cottontail rabbit.
And his brother was exactly like him,
only a little bit less white on his tail,
so it seemed best to call him "Tot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>tontail's
Brother;" and he had such
a funny way of putting his ears back,
it made him look like an old man; so
sometimes they could not help calling
him "Grandfather." Altogether there
seemed to be a very good reason for
every name in the whole family, and
I think there was just as good a reason
for calling "Lily" "White Lily."
However, as Phil said, "anybody
could see she was white; and nobody
ever heard of a black lily anyhow, and
it saved time to say just 'Lily.'"</p>

<h2>III.</h2>


<p>Mr. Frank Wellington's house
was an old-fashioned square wooden
house, with a wide hall running
straight through it from front to
back; at the back was a broad piazza
with a railing around it, and steps
leading down into the back yard.
Grape-vines grew on the sides of this
piazza, and a splendid great polonia-tree,
which had heart-shaped leaves
as big as dinner-plates, grew close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>enough to it to shade it. This was
where Mrs. Wellington used to sit
with her sewing on summer afternoons;
and she often thought that
there couldn't be a prettier sight in
all the world than Rosy Chapman
running among the verbena beds with
her long yellow curls flying behind,
her little bare white feet glancing up
and down among the bright blossoms,
and half a dozen kittens racing
after her. Rosy loved to race with
them better than anything else;
though sometimes she would sit
down in her little rocking-chair, holding
her lap full of them, and rocking
them to sleep. But Johnny made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
more serious business of it. Johnny
wanted to teach them. He had read
about learned pigs and trained fleas,
and he was sure these kittens were a
great deal brighter than either pigs
or fleas could possibly be; so what
do you think Johnny did? He
printed the alphabet in large letters
on a sheet of white pasteboard, nailed
it up on the inside of the largest room
in the cats' house, and spent hours
and hours reading the letters over to
the kittens. He had a scheme of
putting the letters on separate square
bits of pasteboard or paper pasted
on wood, and teaching the kittens to
pick them out; but before he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
that, he wanted to be sure that they
knew them by sight on the paper he
had nailed up, and he never became
sure enough of that to go on any farther
in his teaching. In fact, he never
got any farther than to succeed in
keeping them still for a few minutes
while he read the letters aloud. The
cat that kept still the longest, he said,
was the best scholar that day; he put
their names down in a little book, and
gave them good and bad marks according
as they behaved, just as he
and Rosy used to get marks in school.</p>

</div>

<p>After Johnny got all his flags up,
the cats' house looked very pretty.
It had four flags on it; one was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
big one with the stars and stripes,
and "Our Republic" in big letters
on it; one was a "Garfield and
Arthur" flag, which had been given
to Johnny by the Garfield Club in
Mendon; underneath this was a
small white one Johnny made himself,
with "Hurrah for Both" on it
in rather uneven letters; then at two
of the corners of the house were
small red, white, and blue flags of
the common sort. But the glory
of all was a big flag on a flagstaff
twenty feet high, which Uncle Frank
put up for the boys. This also was
a "Garfield and Arthur" flag, and a
very fine one it was too. The kit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>tens
used to look up longingly at all
these bright flags blowing in the
wind above their house; but Johnny
had taken care to put them high
enough to be beyond their reach even
when they climbed up to the ridgepole.
They would have made tatters
of them all in five seconds if
they could have ever got their claws
into them.</p>

<p>As soon as the kittens were big
enough to enjoy playing with a mouse,
or, perhaps, taking a bite of one,
Mammy Tittleback returned to her
old habits of mouse-catching. There
had never been such a mouser as she
on the farm. It is really true that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
she had several times been known
to catch six mice in five minutes by
Mr. Frank Wellington's watch; and
once she did a thing even more wonderful
than that. This Phil described
to me himself; and Phil is one of the
most exact and truthful boys, and
never makes any story out bigger
than it is.</p>

<p>The place where they used to
have the best fun seeing Mammy
Tittleback catch mice was in the
cornhouse. The floor of the cornhouse
was half covered with cobs
from which the corn had been shelled;
in one corner these were piled up
half as high as the wall. The mice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
used to hide among these, and in
the cracks in the walls; the boys
would take long sticks, push the
cobs about, and roll them from side
to side. This would frighten the
mice and make them run out.
Mammy Tittleback stood in the
middle of the floor ready to spring
for them the minute they appeared.
One day the boys were
doing this, and two mice ran out
almost at the same minute and the
same way. Mammy Tittleback
caught the first one in her mouth;
they thought she would lose the second
one. Not a bit of it. Quick
as a flash she pounced on that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
too, and, without letting go of the
one she already had in her teeth, she
actually caught the second one! Two
live mice at once in her mouth! They
were not alive many seconds, though;
one craunch of Mammy Tittleback's
teeth killed them both, and she
dropped them on the floor, and was
all ready to catch the next ones. Did
anybody ever hear of such a mouser
as that?</p>

<p>Another story also Phil told me
about the kittens which I should have
found it hard to believe if I had read
it in a book; but which I know must
be true, because Phil told it. One day,
after the kittens had grown so big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that they used to go everywhere, the
children went off for a long walk
in the fields, and four of the kittens
went with them. When the children
climbed fences the kittens crawled
through, and they had no trouble till
they came to a brook. The children
just tucked up their trousers and
waded through, first putting the kittens
all down together in a hollow at
the roots of a tree, and telling them
to stay still there till they came back.
They hadn't gone many steps on the
other side when they heard first one
splash, then two, then three; and,
looking round, what should they see
but three of those little kittens swim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>ming
for dear life across the brook,
their poor little noses hardly above
the water? It was as much as ever
they got across; but they did, and
scrambled out on the other side looking
like drowned rats. These were
Spitfire and Gregory Second and
Blacky; Tottontail was the fourth.
He did not appear, and he was not
to be seen, either, where they had put
him down on the other side. At last
they spied him racing up stream as
hard as he could go. He ran till he
came to a place where the brook was
only a little thread of water in the
grass, and there he very sensibly
stepped across; the only one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>whole party, cats or children, who
got over without wet feet. Now
who can help believing that Tottontail
thought it all out in his head, just
as a boy or a girl would who had
never learned to swim? It was very
wonderful that Spitfire and Gregory
and Blacky should have plunged
in to swim across, when they had
never done such a thing before in all
their lives, and of course must have
hated the very touch of water, as all
cats do; but I think it was still more
wonderful in Tottontail to have reasoned
that if he ran along the stream
for a little distance, he might possibly
come to a place where he could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
over by an easier way than swimming,
and without wetting his feet.</p>

</div>

<p>The summer was gone before the
children felt as if it had fairly begun.
Each of them had had a flower-bed"
of his own, and ever so many of the
flowers had gone to seed before the
children had finished their first weeding.
The little cats had enjoyed the
gardens as much as the children had.
When the beds were first planted, and
the green plants were just peeping
up, the kittens were very often scolded,
and sometimes had their ears gently
boxed, to keep them from walking
on the beds; but by August, when
the weeds and the flowers were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
up high and strong together, they
raced in and out among them as
much as they pleased, and had fine
frolics under the poppies and climbing
hollyhock stems.</p>

<p>When the time of Johnny's and
Rosy's visit drew near its end,
Johnny felt very sad at the thought
of leaving his kittens. They were
"just at the prettiest age," he said;
"just beginning to be some comfort,"
after all the pains he had taken to
train them; and he was very much
afraid they would not be so well
taken care of after he had gone.
Fred was going away to school for
the winter, and Phil, he thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
would never have patience to feed
thirteen cats each day. However, he
did all that he could to make them
comfortable for the winter. He
boarded up the sides of their house
snug and warm, so that they need
not suffer from cold; and he made
his Aunt Mary promise to give them
plenty of milk twice a day. Then,
when the time came, he bade them
all good-by one by one, and had a
long farewell talk with his favorite
Spitfire. Rosy, too, felt very sad at
leaving them, but not so sad as
Johnny.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p>Johnny and Rosy and their mother
were to spend the winter at their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>Grandma Jameson's, in the town
of Burnet, only twelve miles from
Mendon, and Johnny said to Spitfire,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It isn't as if we were going so
far off, we couldn't ever come to see
you. We'll be back some day before
Christmas."</p>

<p>"Maow," said Spitfire.</p>

<p>"I'm perfectly sure he understands
all I say," said Johnny. "Don't you,
Spitfire?"</p>

<p>"Maow, maow," replied Spitfire.</p>

<p>"There!" said Johnny triumphantly;
"I knew he did."</p>

<p>It was the middle of October when
Johnny and Rosy left their Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Mary's and went to Grandma Jameson's.
Much to their delight, they
found four cats there.</p>

<p>"A good deal better than none,"
said Johnny.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rosy, "but they're all
old. They won't play tag. They're
real old cats."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, they're better than
none," replied Johnny resolutely.
"They're good to hold, and Snowball's
a splendid mouser."</p>

<p>These cats' names were "Snowball,"
"Lappit," "Stonepile," and
"Gregory." This was the old "Gregory"
after whom the kitten "Gregory
Second" over at Mendon had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
named. "Gregory" had been in
the Jameson family a good many
years.</p>

<h2>IV.</h2>


<p>There was another character who
had been in the Jameson family a
good many years, about whom I
must tell you, because he will come
in presently in connection with this
history of the cats. In fact, he has
more to do with the next part of the
history than even Johnny and Rosy
have. This is an old colored man
who takes care of Grandma Jameson's
farm for her. He is as good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
an old man as "Uncle Tom" was, in
"Uncle Tom's Cabin," and I'm
sure he must be as black. He lives
in a little house in a grove of chestnut
and oak trees, just across the
meadow from Grandma Jameson's;
and, summer and winter, rain or shine,
he is to be seen every morning at
daylight coming up the lane ready
for his day's work. His name is
Jerry; he is well known all over
Burnet, and he is one of the old
men that nobody ever passes by
without speaking. "Hullo, Jerry!"
"How de do, Jerry?" "Is that you,
Jerry?" are to be heard on all sides
as Jerry goes through the street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a mule, too, that Jerry
drives, which is almost as well known
as Jerry. There is a horse also on
the farm; but the horse is so fat he
can't go as fast as the mule does.
So the mule and the horse have gradually
changed places in their duties;
the horse does the farm work and the
mule goes to town on errands; and
there is no more familiar sight in all
the town of Burnet than the Jameson
Rockaway drawn by the mule
Nelly, with old Jerry sitting sidewise
on the low front seat, driving. There
isn't a week in the year that Jerry
doesn't go down to the railway station
at least once, and sometimes sev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>eral
times, in this way, to bring some
of Grandma Jameson's children or
grandchildren or nieces or nephews or
friends to come and make her a visit.
Her house is one of the houses that
never seems to be so full it can't hold
more. You know there are some
such houses; the more people come,
the merrier, and there is always room
made somehow for everybody to sleep
at night.</p>

<p>You wouldn't think to look at the
house that it could hold many people;
it is not large. In truth, I cannot
myself imagine, often as I have
stayed in the dear old place, where
all the people have slept when I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
known twelve or more to come down
to breakfast of a morning, all looking
as if they had had a capital night's
rest. Jerry is always glad as anybody
in the house when visitors come;
yet it makes him no end of work, carrying
them and their luggage back
and forth to town, with all the rest
of the errands he has to do. Nelly
is pretty old, and the Rockaway is
small, and many a time Jerry has to
make two trips to get one party of
people up to the house, with all that
belongs to them in the way of trunks
and bags and bundles; but he likes it.
He pulls off his old drab felt hat, and
bows, and holds out both hands, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
everybody who comes shakes hands
with Jerry, first of all, at the station.</p>

<p>One day, late in last October, Jerry
was at the post-office waiting for the
mail; when it came in, there was a
postal card from Mendon for Mrs.
Jameson, and as the postmistress
is Mrs. Jameson's own niece, she
thought she would look at the message
on the card, and see if all were
well at Mr. Frank Wellington's.
This was what she found written
on the card,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Meet company at the three o'clock
train."</p>

<p>That was the train which had just
come in and brought the mail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" said she. "Jerry, it is
well I looked at this card. It is from
Mr. Wellington, and he says there
will be company down by the three
o'clock train, to go to Grandma's.
You must turn round and go right
to the station; they will be waiting,
and wondering why nobody's there
to meet them."</p>

<p>"That's a fact," said Jerry;
"they've done sure, wonderin' by
this time; 'spect they've walked up;
but I'll go down 'n' see."</p>

<p>So Jerry made as quick time as he
could coax out of the mule, down to
the railway station. The train had
been gone more than half an hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and the station was quiet and deserted
by all except the station-master,
who was waiting for the up-train,
which would be along in an hour.</p>

<p>"Been anybody here to go up to
our house?" asked Jerry. "We got
a postal, sayin' there'd be company
down on the three o'clock."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the station-master,
looking curiously at Jerry, "there was
some company came on that train for
your folks."</p>

<p>"What became on 'em?" said
Jerry. "Hev they walked?"</p>

<p>"Well, no; they hain't walked;
they're in the Freight Depot," said
the man rather shortly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry thought this was the queerest
thing he ever heard of.</p>

<p>"In the Freight Depot!" exclaimed
he. "What'd they go there
for? Who be they?"</p>

<p>"You'll find 'em there," replied the
man, and turned on his heel.</p>

<p>Still more bewildered, Jerry hurried
to the Freight Depot, which was
on the opposite side of the railroad
track, a little farther down. Now I
am wondering if any of you children
will guess who the "company" were
that had come from Mendon by the
three o'clock train to go to Grandma
Jameson's. It makes me laugh so
to think of it, that I can hardly write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the words. I don't believe I shall
ever get to be so old that it won't
make me laugh to think about this
batch of visitors to Grandma Jameson's.</p>

<p>It was nothing more nor less than
all Johnny Chapman's cats! Yes, all
of them,&mdash;Mammy Tittleback, Juniper,
Mousiewary, Spitfire, Blacky,
Coaley, Limbab, Lily, Gregory Second,
Tottontail, Tottontail's Brother,
Beauty, Clover. There they all were,
large as life, and maowing enough
to make you deaf. Poor things! it
wasn't that they were uncomfortable,
for they were in a very large box, with
three sides made of slats, so they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
plenty of room and plenty of air;
but of course they were frightened
almost to death. The box was addressed
in very large letters to</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Captain Johnny Chapman<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
First Lieutenant Rose Chapman.</span><br /><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Above this was printed in still bigger
letters,</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">
THE GARFIELD CLUB.<br /><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Some of the men who were at the
station when the box came, were made
very angry by this. They did not
know anything about the history of
the cats; and of course they could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
see that the thing had any meaning
at all, except as an insult to the Garfield
Club in Burnet. It was just
before Election, you see, and at that
time all men in the United States are
so excited they become very touchy
on the subject of politics; and all the
Garfield men who saw this great box
of mewing cats labelled the "Garfield
Club" thought the thing had been
done by some Democrat to play off
a joke on the Republicans. So they
went to a paint-shop, and got some
black paint, and painted, on the other
side of the box, "Hancock Serenaders."
That was the only thing they
could think of to pay off the Demo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>crats
whom they suspected of the
joke.</p>

<p>Jerry knew what it meant as soon
as he saw the box. He had heard
from Johnny and Rosy all about their
wonderful cats over at Uncle Frank's,
and how terribly they missed them;
but it had never crossed anybody's
mind that Uncle Frank would send
them after the children. Poor Jerry
didn't much like the prospect of his
ride from the station to the house;
however, he put the box into the
Rockaway, got home with it as
quickly as possible, and took it immediately
to the barn.</p>

<p>Then he went into the house with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the mail, as if nothing had happened.
Jerry was something of a wag in his
way, as well as Mr. Frank Wellington;
so he handed the letters to Mrs.
Chapman without a word, and stood
waiting while she looked them over.
As soon as she read the postal she
exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Jerry, this is too bad. There's
company down at the station; came
by the three o'clock train. You'll
have to go right back and get them.
I wonder who it can be."</p>

<p>"They've come, ma'am," said
Jerry quietly.</p>

<p>"Come!" exclaimed Mrs. Chapman;
"come? Why, where are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
they?" and she ran out on the piazza.
Jerry stopped her, and coming nearer
said, in a low, mysterious tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>"They're in the barn, ma'am!"</p>

<p>"Jerry! In the barn! What do
you mean?" exclaimed Mrs. Chapman.
And she looked so puzzled
and frightened that Jerry could not
keep it up any longer.</p>

<p>"It's the cats, ma'am," he said;
"them cats of Johnny's from Mr.
Wellington's: all of 'em. The men
to the station said there was forty;
but I don't think there's more 'n
twenty; mebbe not so many 's that;
they're rowin' round so, you can't
count 'em very well."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" said Mrs.
Chapman. "What won't Frank
Wellington do next!" Then she
found her mother, and told her, and
they both went out to the barn to look
at the cats. Jerry lifted up one of
the slats so that he could put in a
pail of milk for them; and as soon
as they saw friendly faces, and heard
gentle voices, and saw the milk, they
calmed down a little, but they were
still terribly frightened. Grandma
Jameson could not help laughing,
but she was not at all pleased.</p>

<p>"I think Frank Wellington might
have been in better business," she
said. "We do not want any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
cats here; the winter is coming, when
they must be housed. What is to be
done with the poor beasts?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll give most of them
away, mother," said Mrs. Chapman.
"They're all splendid kittens; anybody'll
be glad of them."</p>

<p>"I do not think thee will find any
dearth of cats in the village; it seems
to be something most families are
supplied with: but thee can do what
thee likes with them; they can't be
kept here, that is certain," replied
Mrs. Jameson placidly, and went
into the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chapman and Jerry decided
that the cats should be left in the box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
till morning, and the children should
not be told until then of their arrival.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Chapman was putting
Johnny and Rosy to bed, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Johnny, if Uncle Frank should
send your cats over here, you would
have to make up your mind to give
some of them away. You know,
Grandma couldn't keep them all!"</p>

<p>"What makes you think he'll send
them over?" cried Johnny. "He
didn't say he would."</p>

<p>"No," replied Mrs. Chapman, "I
know he didn't; but I think it is very
likely he found them more trouble,
after you went away, than he thought
they would be."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"I got them fixed real comfortable
for the winter," said Johnny. "Their
house is all boarded up, so 't will be
warm; but I'd give anything to have
them here. There's plenty of room
in the barn. They needn't even come
into the house."</p>

<p>It took a good deal of reasoning
and persuading to bring Johnny to
consent to the giving away of any of
his beloved cats, in case they were
sent over from Mendon; but at last
he did, and he and Rosy fell asleep
while they were trying to decide which
ones they would keep, and which ones
they would give away, in case they
had to make the choice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<h2>V.</h2>


<p>In the morning, after breakfast, the
news was told them, that the cats had
arrived the night before and were in
the barn. Almost before the words
were out of their mother's mouth they
were off like lightning to see them.
Jerry was on hand ready to open the
box, and the whole family gathered
to see the prisoners set free. What
a scene it was! As soon as the slats
were broken enough to give room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
out the cats sprang, like wild creatures,
heads over heels, heels over
heads, the whole thirteen in one tumbling
mass. They ran in all directions
as fast as they could run, poor Rosy
and Johnny in vain trying to catch so
much as one of them.</p>

<p>"They're crazy like," said Jerry;
"they've been scared enough to kill
'em; but they'll come back fast
enough. Ye needn't be afeard," he
added kindly to Johnny, who was
ready to burst out crying, to see even
his beloved Spitfire darting away like
a strange wildcat of the woods. Sure
enough, very soon the little ones began
to stick their heads out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
behind beams and out of corners,
and to take cautious steps towards
Johnny, whose dear voice they recognized
as he kept saying, pityingly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poor kitties, poor kitties, come
here to me; poor kitties, don't you
know me?" In a few minutes he
had Spitfire in his arms, and Rosy
had Blacky, the one she had always
loved best. Mammy Tittleback, Juniper,
and Mousiewary had escaped
out of the barn, and disappeared in
the woods along the mill-race. They
were much more frightened than the
kittens, and had reason to be, for they
knew very well that it was an extraordinary
thing which had happened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
them, whereas the little ones did
not know but it often happened
to cats to be packed up in boxes
and take journeys in railway trains,
and now that they saw Johnny and
Rosy, they thought everything was
all right.</p>

<p>In the mean time the cats of the
house, Snowball, Gregory, Stonepile,
and Lappit, hearing the commotion
and caterwauling in the barn, had
come out to see what was going on.
On the threshold they all stopped,
stock still, set up their backs, and
began to growl. The little kittens
began to sneak off again towards
hiding-places. Snowball came for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>ward,
and looked as if she would make
fight, but Johnny drove her back, and
said very sharply, "Scat! scat! we
don't want you here." On hearing
these words, Gregory and the others
turned round and walked scornfully
away, as if they would not take any
more notice of such young cats; but
Snowball was very angry, and continued
to hang about the barn, every
now and then looking in, and growling,
and swelling up her tail, and she
never would, to the last, make friends
with one of the new-comers.</p>

<p>Release had come too late for poor
Gregory Second and Lily. They had
never been strong as the others, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the fright of the journey was too much
for them. Early on the morning
after their arrival, Gregory Second
was found dead in the barn. The
children gave him a grand funeral,
and buried him in the meadow behind
the house. There were staying
now at Mrs. Jameson's two other
grandchildren of hers, Johnny and
Katy Wells; and the two Johnnies
and Katy and Rosy went out, in a
solemn procession, into the field to
bury Gregory. Each child carried a
cat in its arms, and the rest of the cats
followed on, and stood still, very serious,
while Gregory was laid in the
ground. The boys filled up the grave,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>made a good-sized mound over it, and
planted a little evergreen-tree at one
end. They also set very firmly, on
the top of the mound, what Johnny
called "a kind of marble monument."
It was the marble bottom of an old
kerosene lamp. When this was all
done, the children sang a hymn,
which they had learned in their
school.</p>

<p>This song had come to Burnet
years before, in a magazine. There
was no other printed copy of the
song; but, year after year, the Burnet
children had sung it at school, and
every child in town knew it by heart.</p>

<p>It cannot be said to be exactly a funeral
hymn, and Gregory was a gray
cat and not a black one, which made
it still less appropriate; but it was
the only song they knew about cats,
so they sang it slow, and made it do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Just as they were finishing it a big
dog came darting down from the other
side of the mill-race, leaped over the
race, barking loud, and sprang in
among them.</p>

<p>This gave the relatives a great
scare. All those that were standing
on the ground scrambled up the nearest
trees as fast as they could; and
even those that were being held in the
children's arms scratched and fought
to get down, that they might run away
too. So the funeral ended very suddenly
in great disorder, and with altogether
more laughing than seemed
proper at a funeral.</p>

<p>The next day Lily died and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
buried by the side of Gregory, but
with less ceremony than had been
used the day before. Over her grave
was put a high glass monument, which
made much more show than the one
of marble on Gregory's grave. That
was only a flat slab, which lay on the
grass; but Lily's was a glass lamp
which had by some accident got a
little broken. This, set bottom side
up, pressed down firmly into the earth,
made a fine show, and could be seen
a good way off, "the way a monument
ought to be," Johnny said; and
he searched diligently to find something
equally high and imposing for
Gregory's grave, but could not find it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of a few days the remaining
kittens and cats were all given
away, except Mammy Tittleback and
Blacky. They were selected as being
on the whole the best ones to
keep. Mammy Tittleback is so good
a mouser that she would be a useful
member of any family, and Blacky
bids fair to grow up as good a mouser
as she. What became of Juniper and
Mousiewary was never known. They
were seen now and then in the neighborhood
of the house, but never stayed
long, and finally disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>Mammy Tittleback, I am sorry to
say, did not take the loss of her fam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>ily
in the least to heart; after the first
week or two she seemed as contented
and as much at home in her new quarters
as if she had lived there all her
life. What she has thought about it
all, there is no knowing; but as she
and Blacky lie asleep under the stove,
of an evening, you'd never suspect, to
look at them, that they had had such
a fine summer house to live in last
year, or had ever belonged to a "Garfield
Club," and taken a railway journey.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>This story of Mammy Tittleback and
her family was told to me last winter, at
Christmas time, in Grandma Jameson's
house, by Johnny and Rosy Chapman and
their mother, and by Phil Wellington and
his mother, and by Johnny and Katy Wells,
and by Grandma Jameson herself, and by
"Aunt Maggie" Jameson, Grandma Jameson's
daughter, and by "Aunt Hannah,"
Grandma Jameson's sister, and by "Cousin
Fanny," the postmistress who had the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sight of the postal card, and by Jerry, who
had the worst of the whole business, bringing
the box of cats from the railway-station
up to the house.</p>

<p>I don't mean that each of these persons
told me the whole story from beginning to
end. I was not at Grandma Jameson's long
enough for that; I was there only Christmas
day and the day after. But I mean
that all these people told me parts of the
story, and every time the subject was mentioned
somebody would remember something
new about it, and the longer we talked
about it the more funny things kept coming
up to the very last, and I don't doubt that
when I go there again next summer, Phil
and Johnny will begin where they left off and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
tell me still more things as droll as these.
The story about the little kittens swimming
over the brook I did not hear until the
morning I was coming away. Just as I was
busy packing Phil came running up to my
room, saying, "There's one more thing we
forgot the cats did," and then he told me
the story of the swimming. Then I said,
"Tell me some more, Phil; I don't believe
you've told me half yet."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "you see, they were doing
things all the time, and we didn't think
much about 'em. That's the reason we
can't remember," which remark of Phil's has
a good lesson in it when you come to look
at it closely. It would make a good text
for a little sermon to preach to children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
that very often have to say, "I forgot," about
something they ought to have done.</p>

<p>Things that we think very much about
we never forget, any more than we do persons
that we love very dearly and think
very much of. So "I forgot" is not very
much of an excuse for not having done a
thing; it is only another way of saying "I
didn't attend to it enough to make it stay
in my mind," or, "I didn't care enough about
it to remember it."</p>

<p>I heard the greater part of this story on
Christmas night. Johnny and Rosy and
Phil and Katy had a great frolic telling it.
In the midst of it Johnny exclaimed, "Don't
you want to see Mammy Tittleback?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," I replied. So he ran out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to the barn and brought her in in his arms.
Snowball was already there. She was lying
on the hearth when Mammy Tittleback was
brought in, and I began to praise her, saying
what a beauty she was, and how handsome
the yellow, black, and white colors in
her fur were. Snowball got up, and began
to walk about uneasily and to rub up against
us, as if she wanted to be noticed also.</p>

<p>"Snowball's a nice cat too," said Phil,
picking her up, "'most as good as Mammy
Tittleback."</p>

<p>"Blacky's the nicest," said Rosy, who
was rocking in her rocking-chair, and hugging
Blacky up close to her face. "Blacky's
the nicest of them all." Upon which everybody
fell to telling what a tyrant Blacky had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
become; how she would be held in somebody's
lap all the time, and that even Aunt
Hannah had had to give up to Blacky.
Even Aunt Hannah, whom nobody in the
house, not even Grandma Jameson herself,
ever thinks of going against in the smallest
thing, because she is such a beautiful and
venerable old lady,&mdash;even Aunt Hannah
had had to give up to Blacky.</p>

<p>Aunt Hannah is over eighty years old
but she is never idle. She never has time
to hold cats in her lap; and, besides, I do
not think she loves cats so well as the rest
of her family do. As often as Blacky
jumped up in her lap, Aunt Hannah would
very gently set her on the floor; but in five
minutes Blacky would be up again. At last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
when she found Aunt Hannah really would
not hold her in her lap, she took it in her
head to lie in Aunt Hannah's work-basket,
close by her side; and just as often as Aunt
Hannah put her out of her lap she would
spring into the work-basket, and curl herself
up like a little puff-ball of fur among
the spools. This was even worse to Aunt
Hannah than to have her on her knees, and
she would take her out of the work-basket
less gently than she lifted her out of her
lap, and set her on the floor. Then Blacky
would jump right up on her lap again, and
so they had it,&mdash;Aunt Hannah and Blacky,&mdash;first
lap, and then work-basket, till poor
Aunt Hannah got as nearly out of patience
as a lovely old lady of the Society of Friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
ever allows herself to be. She got so out of
patience that she made a very nice, soft,
round cushion stuffed with feathers, and kept
it always at hand for Blacky to lie on. Then
when Blacky jumped on her knees, she laid
her on the cushion; instantly Blacky would
spring into the work-basket, and when she
took her out of that, right up in her lap
again. On that cushion she would not lie.
At last Aunt Hannah was heard to say, "I
believe it is of no use, I'll have to give up
to thee, little cat;" and now Blacky lies in
Aunt Hannah's work-basket whenever she
feels like lying there instead of in Rosy's
little chair or in somebody's lap; and I
dare say by the time I go to Burnet again,
I shall find that Aunt Hannah has given up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>in the matter of the lap also, and is holding
Blacky on her knees as many hours a day
as anybody else in the house.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of discussion
among the children as to the places where
the little kittens were living now, and as to
which ones were given away, and which
ones had run away.</p>

<p>I suppose when Jerry had a half-dozen
kittens to give away all at once, he couldn't
stop to select them very carefully, or to sort
them out by name, or recollect where each
one went.</p>

<p>"I know where Spitfire is," said Johnny;
"I saw him yesterday."</p>

<p>"Where?" said Phil.</p>

<p>"I won't tell," said Johnny, "but I know."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Juniper, he ran away. He'll take care
of himself. He used to come back once in
a while. We'd see him round the barn.
Mousiewary, she comes sometimes now; I
saw her the other day. She's real smart."</p>

<p>"Well, old Mammy Tittleback's the best
of 'em all," said Phil, catching her up and
trying to make her snuggle down in his lap.
But Mammy Tittleback did not like to be
held. She wriggled away, jumped down,
and walked restlessly toward the kitchen
door. Phil followed, opened the door, and
let her go out. "She won't let you pet her,"
he said; "she's a real business cat, she
always was. She likes to stay in the barn
and hunt rats better than anything in the
world, except when it's so cold she can't."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"She used to let me hold her sometimes
in the summer," said Rosy.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was different. She had to be
staying round then, doing nothing, to look
after the kittens," replied Phil. "She wasn't
wasting any time then being held, but she
won't let you hold her now more 'n two
or three minutes at a time. She jumps
right down, and goes off as if she was sent
for."</p>

<p>After the children had gone to bed, Mrs.
Chapman told us a very droll part of the
history of the cats' journey,&mdash;what might
be called the sequel to it. The Democrats
were not the only people in the village who
took offence at the sight of the cats. There
is a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to Animals in Burnet, and some of the people
who belonged to this society, when they
heard of the affair, took it into their heads
that Mr. Frank Wellington had done a very
cruel thing in shutting so many cats up in
a box together. It was a very good illustration
of the way stories grow big in many
times telling, the way the number of those
cats went on growing bigger and bigger
every time the story was told. At last they
got it up as high as forty-five; and there
really were some people in town who believed
that forty-five cats had come from
Mendon to Burnet in that box. "Jerry
says they haven't ever had it lower than
twenty-five," said Mrs. Chapman. "It runs
all the way from forty-five to twenty-five,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
but twenty-five is the lowest, and there was
one man in the town who really did threaten
pretty seriously to enter a complaint against
Frank Wellington with the society, but I
guess he was laughed out of it. It is almost
a pity he didn't do it, it would have
been such a joke all round."</p>

<p>This is all I have to tell you about
Mammy Tittleback and her family now.
When I go back to Burnet next summer, I
hope I shall find her with six more little
kittens, and Johnny and Rosy as happy
with them as they were with Spitfire,
Blacky, Coaley, Limbab, Lily, and Gregory
Second.</p>
